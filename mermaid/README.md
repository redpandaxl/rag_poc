# RAG-POC Project Diagrams

This directory contains Mermaid diagrams to visualize the structure and operation of the RAG-POC project.

## Available Diagrams

1. **System Architecture** (`system_architecture.md`): Overall system architecture showing the major components and their interactions.

2. **Data Ingestion Flow** (`data_ingestion_flow.md`): Detailed view of the data processing pipeline, from file detection to vector storage.

3. **RAG Process Flow** (`rag_process_flow.md`): Sequence diagram showing how user queries are processed through the RAG system.

4. **Component Interactions** (`component_interactions.md`): Graph showing the relationships between the different code modules in the system.

5. **Database Schema** (`database_schema.md`): Entity-relationship diagram for the data structures used in the system.

6. **Network Topology** (`network_topology.md`): Diagram showing the system's network architecture and communication patterns.

7. **File Structure** (`file_structure.md`): Tree diagram of the project's directory and file organization.

8. **Dependency Graph** (`dependency_graph.md`): Graph showing the dependencies between different code modules.

9. **Class Diagram** (`class_diagram.md`): UML-style diagram showing the main classes in the system and their relationships.

## Viewing the Diagrams

These diagrams are written using the Mermaid syntax. You can view them in several ways:

1. **GitHub**: GitHub automatically renders Mermaid diagrams in markdown files.

2. **Mermaid Live Editor**: Copy the diagram code and paste it into the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/) for an interactive view.

3. **VS Code**: Use the Mermaid extension in VS Code to preview diagrams.

4. **Browser Extension**: Install a Mermaid viewer extension for your browser.

## Updating the Diagrams

As the project evolves, these diagrams should be updated to reflect changes in architecture and functionality.
